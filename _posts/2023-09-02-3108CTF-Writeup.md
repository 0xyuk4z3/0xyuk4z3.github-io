Welcome to my write-up for the 3108 CTF: Warkah Untuk Perwira organized by BahteraSiber. This CTF presented numerous smaller challenges, but I will be focusing on providing in-depth writeups of the main challenges that highlight key ethical hacking methodologies.

###### Bonus Merdeka Quest

This is a small write up for the bonus Merdeka giveaway.

Let's start by going into the google drive link provided. Download the files and examine the contents.

A quick analysis using these two commands.

```
cat info.txt
file dumb.raw
```

After examining, it seems like we would have to find a flag with the format 3108{FLAG} inside the .raw file which we further analyzed using the **file** command. We reckon that it might be a windows memory dump file.

For memory dumps, we can use volatility3 for further analysis... let's download the tool.

[https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility3](https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility3)

```
git clone https://github.com/volatilityfoundation/volatility3.git
cd volatility3
```

Start the tool and let's check out the help page to see what we can work with. Since we know this is a windows dump file, we will just focus on the windows plugins.

```
python3 vol.py -h
```

Considering that we would have to somehow find a flag, the flag text might be placed in a file. So, let's first scan for files by using the** windows.filescan** plugin. The plugin lists all the files that are in the memory dump.

```
vol.py -f dumb.raw windows.filescan 
```

![1727355285381](../assets/img/2023-09-02-3108CTF-Writeup/1727355285381.png)

After the scan finishes.. as a start, let's just try using the search function (CTRL + SHIFT + F) in the terminal to find any files named "flag"... and we found two files named **flag.rtf** and **flag or not.txt.**

![1727355325691](../assets/img/2023-09-02-3108CTF-Writeup/1727355325691.png)

Now that we found the flag files, we can examine the content by dumping the files using the **windows.dumpfiles **plugin. We take the respective offset number from the filescan results for each of the files so we can examine individually. We output the results in a folder we created name "files".

| Offset         | File name       |
| -------------- | --------------- |
| 0x96080108ec30 | flag.rtf        |
| 0x960802c47830 | flag_or_not.txt |

```
python3 vol.py -f dumb.raw -o ./files windows.dumpfiles --virtaddr 0x96080108ec30
python3 vol.py -f dumb.raw -o ./files windows.dumpfiles --virtaddr 0x960802c47830
```

Examine the content of the files in the folder that we outputted using a rich text format editor for the** .rtf **file.

![1727355473273](../assets/img/2023-09-02-3108CTF-Writeup/1727355473273.png)

The flag is **3108{MEMORY-DUMP}**
